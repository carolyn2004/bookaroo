# MyApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

Problem: 
Many people have books they no longer need or want, which could be of great interest to others. However, there's a lack of a convenient, centralized platform for exchanging these books. Traditional methods of donating or selling books can be cumbersome and don't always ensure the books reach those who would value them most.

Peer-to Peer (P2P) Book Exchange Platform. This web application will facilitate the easy listing, searching, and exchanging of books among users. By creating a community-driven platform, we aim to make book exchange as easy as clicking a button, ensuring books find new readers who appreciate them.

#My Idea:
create like a dating platform but for books + a bit of inspiration from carousell

User can sign up for an account -> then login

User get to see a list of books (will have search ability to search for specific book), books can also be filtered by category as well

Once user see a book he/she like, you can tap on the (request exchange button) will be prompted to select based on what books they have uploaded that they wish to exhchange and from there the other user will recieve an exchange request. 

User can choose to chat with the user, discuss what they like about the book before "accepting exchange".

# Implementated: 
Front End
# To be Implemented:
Backend + Google Firebase Firestore (making the app functional with API)
# Creative Features I would implement in the future:
- When the user first joins the app, they will be able to indicate the types of book they like to read
- Based on available data, use AI to recommend books user might be interested in
