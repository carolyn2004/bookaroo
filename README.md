# bookaroo (work in progress)

Problem Statement: Many people have books they no longer need or want, which could be of great interest to others. However, there is a lack of a convenient, centralized platform for exchanging these books. Traditional methods of donating or selling books can be cumbersome and do not always ensure the books reach those who would value them most.

Solution: This Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Book Exchange Platform is a web application designed to facilitate the easy listing, searching, and exchanging of books among users. By creating a community-driven platform, we aim to make book exchange as easy as clicking a button, ensuring that books find new readers who appreciate them.

## Features (In Idea)
User Authentication:
Users can sign up for an account and login securely.

Book Listing & Search:
Users can list books they wish to exchange.
Books can be searched by title, author, or other criteria.
Filters are available to sort books by categories like genre, author, or publication year.

Request Exchange:
Once a user finds a book they are interested in, they can tap the 'Request Exchange' button.
Users will be prompted to select books they have uploaded and are willing to exchange in return.
The book owner will receive the exchange request.

Chat Functionality:
Users can chat with each other to discuss the books and their preferences before agreeing to exchange.
Profile & Exchange History:

Each user has a profile that displays their exchange history and the number of successful exchanges theyâ€™ve made, as well as all the books they have uploaded to Bookaroo
